Must I Use AS Together With ELB and Cloud Eye?
==============================================

AS can work independently or in conjunction with ELB and Cloud Eye.

Cloud Eye does not require additional fees and is enabled by default. ELB is not enabled by default, but you can enable it manually if needed, for example, if distributed clusters are required.
