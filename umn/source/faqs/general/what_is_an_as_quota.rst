What Is an AS Quota?
====================

What Is a Quota?
----------------

A quota limits the quantity of a resource available to users, thereby preventing spikes in the usage of the resource. For example, an AS group quota limits the number of AS groups that can be created per account. You can also request for an increased quota if your existing quota cannot meet your service requirements.

This section describes how to view the used AS quotas and the total quotas in a specified region.

How Do I View My Quotas?
------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.

#. In the upper right corner of the page, click |image2|.

   The **Service Quota** page is displayed.

#. View the used and total quota of each type of resources on the displayed page.

   If a quota cannot meet service requirements, apply for a higher quota.
