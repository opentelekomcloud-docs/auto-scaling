What Are the Conditions to Trigger an Alarm-based AS Policy?
============================================================

Alarms will be triggered by metrics of CPU Usage, Memory Usage, Inband Incoming Rate, Inband Outgoing Rate, Disk Read Rate, Disk Write Rate, Disk Read Requests, and Disk Write Requests. These alarms will in turn trigger the policy to scale instances in or out in the AS group.
